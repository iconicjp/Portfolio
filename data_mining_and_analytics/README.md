# LIS761 - Data Mining and Analytics

## This course was focused on data mining techniques and tools. I primarily used Orange Data Mining and Weka

*NLP* is a canvas demonstrating common natural language processing techniques.

*water_potability* is a project I completed to predict the potability of a sample of water based on supervised learning on other samples. I construted a workflow to test different machine learning algorithms to see which was best for this scenario. I also included the csv for the sample data.
