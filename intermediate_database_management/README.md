# LIS3784 - Intermediate Database Management

## Jevon Price

This class was an intermediate level SQL and database management class. A1-A3 and P1 are done in MySQL, and the rest are done in SQL Server. Below are the units. For most of the units, we modeled and built databases. We then created database objects such as views, stored procedures, transactions, and triggers.

* [A1](/a1/README.md) is a SQL refresher. We downlaoded the necessary software and completed the setups needed for the class. We also ran some SQL code to refresh our knowledge and make sure everything was running properly.
* In [A2](/a2/README.md) we designed and built a database for a university.
* In [A3](/a3/README.md) we designed and built a database for a library
* In [P1](/p1/README.md) we designed and built a database to track bank account transactions.
* [A4](/a4/README.md) is an introduction to SQL server. We did a sample database creations, and we also recreated the database from P1 and ran reports on it.
* In [A5](/a5/README.md) we designed and built a database for a ~~slumlord~~ landlord.
* In [P2](/p2/README.md) we designed and built a database for a hospital.
