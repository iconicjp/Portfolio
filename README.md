## This is a Repo demonstrating some of the projects I have completed.

**Folder Links:**
### SQL
1. [LIS3784: Intermediate Database Management](intermediate_database_management/README.md)
    - This class is focused on learning SQL and relational database design. It teaches good database design, implementation, and management concepts and techniques. Half of this class was completed in MySQL and the other half in MS SQL Server.

2. [LIS3781: Advanced Database Management](advanced_database_management/README.md)
    - This class is focused on DMBS managment and Advanced SQL techniques. The class goes over MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle and MongoDB(NoSQL).

### Python
1. [LIS4369: Extensible Enterprise Solutions](extensible_enterprise_solutions/README.md)
    - This is a class focused on Python and R. Most of the work centered around learning these languages and using them to analyze data (Notably Jupyter Notebook and Pandas). I also learned Git and some Linux in this class.

2. [LIS4761: Data Mining and Analytics](data_mining_and_analytics/README.md)
    - This class was centered around data mining and analytic techniques and tools. I primarily used Orange Data Mining with some Weka.

3. [Stock Level Creator](stock_level_creator/README.md)
    - This is a personal project of mine written in Python. It takes a watchlist of stocks and outputs a file with levels for each stock in that watchlist. I then run another script to insert the levels on my TradingView chart.

### Data Visualization
1. [Power BI](PowerBI/README.md)
    - These are projects I found on the web to help me learn and refresh my knowledge on Power BI.
